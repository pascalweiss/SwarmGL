SwarmGL
=======
This peace of software was made for simulating swarm behaviour. It was developed during a course on computer graphics at HTW-Berln. As inspiration, we took starling swarms, such as the one shown in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmO4Ellgmd0. Although we couldn't reproduce the same behaviour, there are still tendencies. Watch a preview video here 

# Dependencies 
- GLFW
- GLFW
- glm
Check the folder `external`..

# Handling
In `GLOBALS.json`(which should be in the same directory as the executable), there are some values, you can modify. By doing so, you can alter the behaviour of the Swarm.

Mode
¯¯¯¯
`0` - allows the particles to leave the space
`1` - permits the particles to leave the space
